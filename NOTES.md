a problem consists of a radical (optional) and a frac ( 2 <= q <= 5 with 5 being rare):
\sqrt[q]{frac}
frac has two parts, a numerator and a denomenator (optional)
each part is (a, b, are simple expressions, c, d are complex expressions, n, m are integers, can omit some terms):
a^n * b^m * c * d
complex expressions look like (g, h are simple expressions, but h shows up rarely):
g (+ h)
simple expressions look like (w, x, y, z are variables, p, q, r, s are integers, k is a NON-ZERO integer, can omit some terms):
k * w^p * x^q * y^r * z^s
exponents are of the form (e, f are integers, p is a variable, rarely shows up, DO NOT USE P WITH A RADICAL):
e (+ f*p)


Assumed that all variables are positive

Modes of operation:
- Quiz mode (radical + frac simplifier)
    - Mixed
    - Integer max (default -20 to 20)
    - No radical
    - No denominator;
    - q = {2,3,4,5}
    - No addition/subtraction of terms
- Exponent practice (number to exponent and back)
    - Mixed
    - Just exp to number
    - Just number to exp
